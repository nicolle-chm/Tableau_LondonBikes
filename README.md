# London Bike's Moving Average in Tableau

In this repository, I created a dashboard in Tableau using the London bike-sharing dataset available in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset). I first imported the dataset in Python to manage the data and then used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that shows bike's moving average and the correlation between temperature and wind speed

In this repository, I've created an interactive Tableau dashboard using the London bike-sharing dataset from Kaggle (available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset)). The dataset was initially processed in Python to manage the data effectively. The Tableau dashboard showcases the moving average of bike rides and explores the correlation between temperature and wind speed. Giving, in this way, an interactive illustration of London Bike's Moving Average.
