TABLEAU PROJECT

In this repository, I created a dashboard in Tableau using the London bike-sharing dataset available in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset). I first imported the dataset in Python to manage the data and then used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that shows bike's moving average and the correlation between temperature and wind speed
